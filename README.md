# trade-project
## What it is

It's a simple trading background which uses CoinDCX apis in order to generate trade XAI crypto currency and (hopefully) generate a little trade profit 


To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.9. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
